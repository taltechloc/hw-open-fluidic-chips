The files here follow 20 mm x 30 mm format and use mini Luer ports (OD = 2 mm). Best used with 3 mm OD (outer diameter), 1 mm ID (inner diameter) silicone tubing. To seal the chip you must use an adhesive foil (e.g. Greiner EASYsealâ„¢ sealing film). 

Supports for 3D printing are included, you don't need to add new supports in the slicer. The flat surface connected to the support pillars must be attached to the printing platform (i.e. print the chip on the side facing down).
