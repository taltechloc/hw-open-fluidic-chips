# Open microfluidic chips
This repo is made for open-source microfluidic chip designs made by the TalTech LoC team. We primarily share 3D printable designs with the odd exception of PDMS-glass 2D layouts. Files are in STL format, which you can slice for your printer of choice. An SLA or DLP printer is needed - we use an [AnyCubic Photon Mono](https://www.anycubic.com/products/photon-mono-resin-3d-printer). 

Formats used:
* Standard microscope slide size (25 mm x 75 mm)

I/O ports used:
* 10-32 threaded fittings
* Mini-Luer ports
